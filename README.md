# Bridge-Improvement-Cost-Prediction-Project
Bridge plays a significant role in infrastructural system. Every year, governments spend money not only on bridge improvement itself, but also on labors to conduct on-site investigation and improvement cost estimation. The traditional process to determine how much to invest in bridge improvement involves 4 stages: project planning, project proposal, preliminary feasibility study, and detailed feasibility study, with allowable deviation >=30%, &lt;=30%, &lt;=20% and &lt;=10% respectively. Our goal is associated with optimizing first two stages with tolerable variability similar to the allowable deviation here. If we could build an algorithm to automate the cost estimation procedure, we can save time and money for governments and realize better budget allocation.
